# **JavaScript Coding Convention (NSL)**

## Variables
- Use lowerCamelCase for variables name.
- Use let (for storing a value which chnages frquently).
- Use const (for storing a constant value).
- Variable name should be noun.
- Always use a meaningful and pronounceable name.
- Use the same type of vocabulary for similar variables.
- Keep all the global variables at the top.

## Functions
- Use meaningful name.
- use the same type of vocabulary for similar functions.
- Use lowerCamelCase for function name.
- Function name should be verb.
- Function name must support the work inside the function.
- Function should do only one thing. Try to avoid if else inside a function. Rather make multiple functions.
- Function should ensure reusability of code and avoid duplication.
- Avoid negative conditioning.
- Where possible, use the function declaration to define functions over function expressions. 
- When using anonymous functions inside a method that requires a function as a parameter, it is acceptable to use an arrow function (although not required).
- If parameter is passed use default argument in function.
- Try to use minimum arguments. Preferably 2-3.
- Encapsulate Conditionals.
- Try to extend existing object using ES6 classes or inheritance, instead of creating the function.
